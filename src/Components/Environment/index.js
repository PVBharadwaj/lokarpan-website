              <p>Right now, in countless rural areas like those we serve, millions of families lack access to safe water, clean toilets, and proper hygiene. For children like those in our communities, this means enduring long walks to collect water, missing school, and facing the risk of illness.</p>
              <p>By supporting Lokarpan's initiatives, you're not just providing waterâ€”you're changing lives. Your contribution helps us conserve precious water sources, ensuring that rural communities can spend more time learning and growing, rather than struggling for the basics.</p>
              <p>Join us in our mission to safeguard water resources, replenish depleted ponds, and protect freshwater ecosystems. Together, we'll make sure that every community we touch has access to clean water, decent sanitation, and the knowledge to maintain a healthy environment for generations to come.</p>
