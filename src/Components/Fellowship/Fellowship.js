                Divya Chaudhary is a globetrotter with a passion for both
                engineering and the arts. Graduating with an undergraduate
                degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Delhi and
                dual masters in Engineering and Management from Sydney, Divya
                has accumulated diverse professional experiences in sales,
                marketing, and user research across India, Australia, and the
                United States. Outside of her professional pursuits, Divya
                immerses herself in art projects, baking, and her love for the
                violin, having played professionally. These experiences have not
                only allowed her to explore remarkable places but also to
                connect with inspiring individuals—an aspect of life she
                cherishes deeply. Currently, Divya is embarking on a journey to
                rediscover her passions, with teaching emerging as a newfound

                believes in the transformative power of education, aspiring not
                just to educate but to inspire dreams.

                Shreya Kothawale is an accomplished architect, dedicated to
                exploring how architecture can contribute to peace-building in
                conflict-affected areas. Collaborating closely with rural
                communities, she addresses pressing issues in under-represented
                villages. Her expertise has earned her an invitation from UN
                Habitat Youth to present her design proposal for public
                sanitation infrastructure in Trans-communities. In addition to
                her impactful work in architecture, Shreya is connected to
                Lokarpan through our design fellowship. Inspired by Lokarpan's
