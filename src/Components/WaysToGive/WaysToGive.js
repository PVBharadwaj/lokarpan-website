              Lokarpan's impactful initiatives are sustained through the
              generosity of philanthropic support. Our programs have thrived
              thanks to the contributions of diverse donors, including
              individuals like yourself. These vital donations often take the
              form of endowment gifts or direct contributions, providing
              essential resources for our work. Additionally, we benefit from
              investment assets and planned gifting, where donors utilise estate
              planning and various funds to secure our ability to continue
              making a meaningful difference.
