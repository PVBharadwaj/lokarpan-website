                    Annapurna is a dedicated midwife (DAI) from the serene
                    village of Ghurau in Kanpur Dehat. In rural settings where
                    formal training is scarce, Mrs. Annapurna relied on age-old
                    practices and the wisdom passed down from her mother to
                    conduct safe deliveries. Recognised for her invaluable
                    service, the village health worker (Nitoo) chose Mrs.
                    Annapurna's humble abode as the venue for their monthly
                    health sessions, where she diligently rallied expecting
                    mothers to attend.

                  <p className="mission-para">
                    During one such enlightening session hosted by Lokarpan,
                    dedicated to training and empowering local midwives, Mrs.
                    Annapurna eagerly enrolled herself for a transformational
                    learning experience. Under the guidance of St. Catherine
                    Hospital, Kanpur, she received comprehensive training and
                    was equipped with a DAI kit containing essential items for
                    safe deliveries and newborn care. Armed with newfound
                    knowledge, Mrs. Annapurna fearlessly embraced her role,
                    bringing safe deliveries to the doorsteps of her community.

                  <p className="mission-para">
                    As time unfolded, the village buzzed with the excitement of
                    Panchayat elections. Encouraged by Nitoo and the village
                    women, Mrs. Annapurna took a leap of faith and contested for
                    a seat. To everyone's delight, she emerged victorious,
                    becoming an integral part of the Panchayat meetings and a
                    beacon of hope for her fellow villagers. Today, Mrs.
                    Annapurna not only continues her noble work of conducting
                    safe deliveries but also tirelessly informs her community
                    about government schemes and initiatives, earning the
                    unwavering trust and admiration of all. This is the

                    healthcare is nothing short of inspiring. When the village

                    Child Survival program's health sessions, Mrs. Usha Devi
                    graciously offered her verandah as the gathering place,

                    for the ASHA Bahu position. With Saroj's guidance and
                    support, Mrs. Usha Devi successfully secured the role,
                    marking a significant turning point in her life. Now, as an
                    ASHA Bahu, she works tirelessly alongside Saroj, ensuring
                    the well-being of the village community. From arranging

                    pregnancy complication due to lack of awareness and
