                    Annapurna is a dedicated midwife (DAI) from the serene
                    village of Ghurau in Kanpur Dehat. In rural settings where
                    formal training is scarce, Mrs. Annapurna relied on age-old
                    practices and the wisdom passed down from her mother to
                    conduct safe deliveries. Recognised for her invaluable
                    service, the village health worker (Nitoo) chose Mrs.
                    Annapurna's humble abode as the venue for their monthly
                    health sessions, where she diligently rallied expecting

                    Annapurna eagerly enrolled herself for a transformational

                    Hospital, Kanpur, she received comprehensive training and
                    was equipped with a DAI kit containing essential items for
                    safe deliveries and newborn care. Armed with newfound
                    knowledge, Mrs. Annapurna fearlessly embraced her role,

                    women, Mrs. Annapurna took a leap of faith and contested for
